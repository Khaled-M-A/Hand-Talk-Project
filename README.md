## Abstract

This paper provides a detailed examination of a system created to help individuals learn sign language using alphabet letters via a real-time camera feed. The goal of the project is to create a machine learning model that can accurately identify and understand sign language letters in real-time, improving accessibility and communication for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. This document covers the project's introduction, data description and structure, methodology, discussion, and results, and concludes with future work suggestions.

##Introduction

"Hand Talk " is a vital mode of communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. Learning sign language, particularly its letters, can be challenging for many people. The development of a real-time sign language recognition system using live camera feeds can significantly aid in this learning process. This project aims to create a machine learning model capable of recognizing sign language letters through a live camera.

The motivation behind this project is to bridge the communication gap between the hearing and deaf communities, promoting inclusivity and accessibility. By leveraging advancements in computer vision and deep learning, we aim to develop a robust system that can operate efficiently in real-world conditions, ensuring high accuracy and user-friendly interaction.

Importance of Hand Talk in Vision 2030
Implementing a system that recognizes sign language in real-time through live camera feeds aligns with the goals of Vision 2030, a strategic framework aimed at reducing Saudi Arabia's dependence on oil, diversifying its economy, and developing public service sectors such as health, education, infrastructure, recreation, and tourism.
