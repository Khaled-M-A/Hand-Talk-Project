## Abstract

Abstract	This paper provides a detailed examination of a system created to help individuals learn sign language using alphabet letters via a real-time camera feed. The goal of the project is to create a machine learning model that can accurately identify and understand sign language letters in real-time, improving accessibility and communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals.
